# LabyREnth2017
Palo-Alto Networks' LabyREnth 2017 CTF writeups

Didn't have much time this year, so I solved only a couple of challanges:

* Threat 1,2
* Docs 1,2,3
* Prog 1,2

I also include a partial writeup for Prog3, which was an interesting challange.

My main goal was to automate the solution as much as possible, and only use my Linux machine.

For the purpose of automation I tried to use Python as much as possible.
