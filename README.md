# LabyREnth2017
Palo-Alto Networks' LabyREnth 2017 CTF writeups

Didn't have much time this year, so I solved only a couple of challanges:

* Threat 1,2
* Docs 1,2,3
* Prog 1,2

My main goal was to automate the solution as much as possible, and only use my Linux machine.

For the purpose of automation I tried to use Python as much as possible.
